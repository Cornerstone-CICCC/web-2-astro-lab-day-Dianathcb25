# Hopes and dreams were dashed that day.
It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.

## My hobbies are:

* Talk about dogs.
* Play with dogs.
* Help dogs in need.
